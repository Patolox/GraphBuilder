# GraphBuilder
An tool that makes graph related operations

Commands:
    
    Left Mouse Button - Select Node
    Right Mouse Button - Build edge between nodes
    1 - Make the selected node the start node
    2 - Make the selected node the end node
    r - Run Algorithm (BFS by default)
    d - Change algorithm to Djikstra
    s - Set cost to selected Node
    q - Reset


Things that would be interesting to add:

    [] Graph animations.
    [] Better UI.
    [] More Algorithms.
    [] Better algorithm implementations.

Feel free to make a PR.
